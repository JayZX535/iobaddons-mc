# Isle of Berk Addons
Documentation, issues, and extra configurations for the Isle of Berk Addons Minecraft mod.

Welcome to the IoB Addons github!  Here, you can find information about the mod, as well as prebuilt configuration files for you to use in the Spawn Configs folder.  These files can be imported into your Minecraft Forge profile's config folder and used to add spawns to various biomes, as well as configuring their rates.  You can see information about each of these files below.

IMPORTANT: No matter which version of the spawns config you download, you MUST rename it to "iobaddons-spawns.json" (no quotation marks), or it will NOT be recognized by the mod and a new defalt configuration will be generated!

ALSO IMPORTANT: IoBA's advanced spawn system is NOT active by default!  You MUST toggle it on in the mod config ("iobaddons-common.toml") or spawns from "iobaddons-spawns.json" will NOT be added.  It is RECOMMENDED (but not required) that you remove all spawns from "isleofberk-spawns.toml" when enabling IoBA's advanced spawn system, as although nothing will inherently break by running both systems, both spawn systems will remain active and may lead to dragon overspawning.

# iobaddons-spawns-default
This file contains the default settings for vanilla biomes ONLY.  It is the same file that the mod generates by default when no config file is found.  You can download it here on github, or it will be generated automatically when the mod is loaded for the first time.  It is a 1:1 mirror of the default spawn rates provided by Isle of Berk itself.
